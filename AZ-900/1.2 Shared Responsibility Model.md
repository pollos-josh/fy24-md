# Shared Responsibility Vs Traditional

## Traditional

In the traditional corporate datacenter, the company is responsible for the physical space and security, and maintaining/replacing servers.

The IT department is responsible for infrastructure and software and updating all the systems.

## Shared Responsibility Model

All these responsibilities and more get shared between the provider and the consumer.

Physical security, cooling, power, and network connectivity are the provider's responsibility.

The consumer is only concerned with the data and information stored in the cloud. The consumer is also responsible of access security and only allowing access to those you give it to.

Other responsibilities depend on the circumstance.

*Cloud SQL Database*

The provider would be responsible for maintaining the database, but the consumer is responsible for the data that is inserted into the database.

*Virtual Machine with SQL Database*

The consumer is responsible for updating and patching the database and also the data that gets fed into it. The provider is only responsible for the virtual machine.
