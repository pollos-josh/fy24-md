# IT Infrastructure Models

## Capital Expenditure (CapEx)

One-time, up-front expenditure to purchase tangible resources.

> [!example] Examples:
> - A new building
> - Repaving the parking lot 
> - Building a datacenter 
> - Buying a company vehicle

## Operational Expenditure (OpEx)

Spending money on products or services over time.

> [!example] Examples:
> Renting a convention center
> Leasing a company vehicle
> Cloud Services

Cloud services are an example of **OpEx** because it functions as a pay-as-you-go model. You only pay for what resources you use.

# Consumption Based Model

## Benefits

- No upfront-costs
- No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that users might not use
- Pay for more resources only when needed
- Stop paying for resources that are unnecessary

> [!info] With a traditional datacenter, you need to estimate the future. When you overestimate, you waste money. When you underestimate you reach capacity and suffer decreased performance. Fixing underperformance takes a lot of time and money.

## Compare Cloud Pricing Models

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet by using a pay-as-you-go pricing model. You typically pay only for the cloud services you use, which helps you:

- Plan and manage your operating costs.
- Run your infrastructure more efficiently.
- Scale as your business needs change.
