[[1.2 Shared Responsibility Model]]
---

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a type of cloud computing service that offers essential compute, storage, and networking resources on demand, on a pay-as-you-go basis. 

**IaaS** bypasses the cost and complexity of acquiring physical servers.

Each resource is offered as a separate component and you only pay for what you use.
