# Introduction to Azure CLI

## Azure Pwsh

It looks like a bare `pwsh` prompt.

Normal `pwsh` commands work

`Get-Date` returns the date like in `pwsh`.

Azure commands have a `az` prefix

```shell
az version

// returns
{  "azure-cli": "2.57.0",
  "azure-cli-core": "2.57.0",
  "azure-cli-telemetry": "1.1.0",
  "extensions": {
    "ai-examples": "0.2.5",
    "ml": "2.22.0",
    "ssh": "2.0.2"
  }
}
```

## Azure Bash

Switch to bash with `bash`
You can update with `az upgrade`

## Azure Interactive

Functions like an IDE with `intellisense`

> [!tip]
> Use the CLI like how you'd use a prompt. It's no different, only with Azure specific commands
