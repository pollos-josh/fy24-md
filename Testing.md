# Software Testing
- Process of executing a program with the intent on finding bugs.
- Validates if requirements are met.
- Ensuring if program is fit for end-users.

*V-Model* - Testing is undertaken in discrete phases.
*Agile* - Iterative and continuous.

# Things to Consider
## Requirements
- Business
- IT Users
- Customers

# Types of Tests
- Functional Testing/System Testing
- Tests application functionality meets requirements.
- Unit Testing >> **DEV TEAM**
- Tests individual units/modules of code.
- Integration Testing
- If individual modules can work together.
- User Acceptance >> *CLIENT/S*
- If application meets end user expectations.
- Non-Functional/Performance
- If application runs and meets non-func. Req.
- Accessibility
- If accessible to users with certain needs.
- Security
- If secure.
- Regressions
- Repeated test to verify any changes to the application hasn't affected existing functionality.
# Testing Cycles
1. Analyze Test
2. Design Test
3. Prepare Test
4. Execute Test

# Test Automation
- Use of specialized testing tools to control and execute tests and compare actual outcomes to predicted outcomes.
	- Examples:
		*Selenium (Front End)*
## Importance:
- Saves time
- Reduces manual effort and cost
- Allows tests to be run 24/7
- Increase test coverage
- Early failure detection and feedback
- Reusability and reliability
- Parallel execution using VMs.

# Applying Intelligence
- Test Optimization
	- How do we test what matters?
- Change Impact Analysis
	- What is changing and how is affecting quality?
- Analytics Guided Testing
	- How to find defects quickly?
- Test Vitality Analytics
	- Are test cases good enough?
- Usage and Failure Patterns
	- Is it root defect or symptom?

# Test Plan
