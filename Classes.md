[[VS .NET]]

Functions like a user defined object. A blueprint and defines a behavior.
Declared with *class*.

```c#
class Currency {
	//fields, properties, methods, etc...
	public string currencyCode {get; set;}
	public string currencySymbol {get; set;}

	public Currency(string code, string symbol) {
		currencyCode = code;
		currencySymbol = symbol;
	}
}
```

New objects are created with:
```c#
Currency unitedStatesCurrency = new Currency("USD","$");
Currency philippinesCurrency = new Currency("PHP", "â‚±");

Console.WriteLine(currency.philippinesCurrency.code)
Console.WriteLine(currency.philippinesCurrency.symbol)
```


## Class vs Struct
Classes are more based. You can put a lot more fields, properties, etc., in classes than in structs.

Structs are smaller and faster in memory.
