# Infra
- Set of physical devices and software required to operate at an enterprise level.
- A "Service Platform"

## Drivers
1. Moore's Law
	*Computing power doubles every 18 months*
2. Nanotechnology
3. Law of Mass Digital Storage
	*Amount of data doubles each year*
4. Metcalfe's Law and Network Economics
	*Power of a network = (2)^n where n = number of people*.
5. Demand for network access increases
6. Declining Comms Cost and the Internet
7. Falling communication cost, utilization explodes
8. Standards and Network Effects
 9. Unleased powerful economics and resulted in price declines due to a narrowing standard.

# IT Infra Components
## Interconnected World
## Regional And Local Networks

# What is Cloud Computing
- Model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of resources.
- Saas - Software as a Service | emails, CRM, productivity
- PaaS - Platform as a Service | database, messaging
- IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service | storage, network
## Characteristics
- On-Demand Self-Service
- Resource Pooling - serving multiple users
- Broad network access - homogenous capabilities
- Rapid Elasticity - able to scale quickly
- Measured Service - able to control and optimize resources
